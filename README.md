Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The problem presented was creating a investment calculator that displayed the total invesments, the interest accrued, both with and without additional savings added.
What did you do particularly well?
I feel I did particularly well with making the calculator dislpay. It is easy to read and displys all the correct information in a organized manner. 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code, in areas of what it can do. It is a pretty simple calculator and it could do much more. I could add some input validation so that people can only put in the correct inputs. 
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Not much of this code was very challenging. The hardest part was figuring our how many spaces was needed to align the display text. I simply kept adding spaces until it was all aligned. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I will likely use the looping functions from this excersize in most of my future projects. 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I added in line comments and made sure to follow best standard practices.
